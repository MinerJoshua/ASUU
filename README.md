#### **ASUU STRIKES** 1999 - 2022(Present) ####

##### **BRIEF** #####
*The education in Nigeria,all around, is less than stellar.  
However in the public school system and tertiary education specifically it has been nothing less than a disgrace. The Academic Staff Union of Universities(ASUU) is constantly going on strike demanding wages.  
It seems many of us have almost accepted this as reality and do not see the severity of the situation.  
My aim with this project is to present the issue with data in the hope that viewing it would shock us to rectify this issue.*

##### **OBJECTIVES** #####
[x] *Scrape ASUU strike table from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_Staff_Union_of_Universities#ASUU_strike_chart_(1999%E2%80%932022))*  
[x] *Perform Calculations to better present the issue*  
[x] *Visualize the Data*  
[x] *Share Visuals and Findings (As well as possible solutions)*
